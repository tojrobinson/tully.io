Hey! My name is Tully Robinson. I'm from Sydney, Australia, and I make things with code.

I find myself most at home in the open source and tech startup worlds. These two communities are full of the types of people I look up to and try to be like. I also find developing in the types of environments that they tend to create to be the most enjoyable.

I am always for a free and open world, especially when it comes to information, and I hope to contribute to the ideal in a meaningful way one day.

Right now, I'm working on a few of my own projects while studying Computer Science at [UNSW](http://www.unsw.edu.au/).

How did I get into programming? 
-------------------------------
Although I had worked on a few web sites before, I didn't get exposed to programming until I started university. I actually began in a commerce/finance degree; however, before I managed to get through my first semster, I had become thoroughly disillusioned with the subjects I was taking and began to look elsewhere for stimulation. This lead me to a field known as [mathematical finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance) which involves the use of quantitative methods for the analyses of financial markets: methods that were often manifested in code. C++ was the lingua franca of [quants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst), so, as well as enrolling in as many maths subjects as I possibly could, I began to teach myself C++ online.

I had no idea what I was doing and wrote some pretty awful code, but it was fun, and I managed to create a working annuity calculator with a sweet command line interface by the end of the semester. I enjoyed the maths/statistics that I took in my second semester a lot, but the chief source of my joy came from the programming I was doing in my free time.

Writing code in my spare time quickly turned into writing code all the time, and after spending my summer break doing just that, it was obvious that I had found my passion. I decided to start afresh in a computer science degree and haven't looked back.

What else?
----------
I used to play golf fairly seriously, and before that, I played poker online a lot. I still enjoy both, as well as trivia and design of all kinds (when it doesn't frustrate the bajeegles out of me), although, since I enjoy coding most of all, I typically end up doing that in my spare time as well (such a nerd!).
