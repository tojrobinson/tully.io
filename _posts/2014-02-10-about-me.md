Hey! My name is Tully Robinson. I'm from Sydney, Australia, and I make things in code.

I have written code for investment banks and big data companies in Australia and the USA; however, my passion is startups. Making something new that could potentially change the way people interpret the world while being directly responsible for it's success or failure is exciting. I also find developing in the types of environments that they create to be the most enjoyable.

Right now, I'm working on a few of my own projects while studying Computer Science at [UNSW](http://www.unsw.edu.au/).

How did I get into programming? 
-------------------------------
Although I had worked on a few web sites before, I didn't get exposed to programming until I started university. I actually began in a commerce/finance degree; however, before I even managed to get through my first semster, I had become thoroughly disillusioned with the subjects I was taking and began to look elsewhere for stimulation. This lead me to a field known as [mathematical finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance) which involved the use of quantitative methods for the analyses of financial markets and these were often manifested in code. C++ was the lingua franca of [quants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst), so, as well as enrolling in as many maths subjects as I possibly could, I began to teach myself C++ in my spare time from various online resources. I had no idea what I was doing and wrote some pretty awful code, but it was fun, and I managed to create a working annuity calculator with a command line interface by the end of the semester. I enjoyed the maths/statistics that I took in my second semester a lot, but the chief source of my joy came from the programming I was doing in my free time.

Writing code in my spare time quickly turned into writing code all the time, and after spending my summer break doing just that, it was obvious that I had found my passion. I promptly started afresh in a computer science degree and haven't looked back since.

What else?
----------
I used to play golf fairly seriously, and before that, I played poker online a lot. I still enjoy both, as well as trivia and design of all kinds (when it doesn't frustrate the bajeegles out of me), although, since I enjoy coding most of all, I typically end up doing that in my spare time as well (such a nerd!).
